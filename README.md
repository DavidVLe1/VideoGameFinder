# VideoGameFinder
A website to recommend video games to a potential user. 

What This Does

1. Ask a user a question - what video game they like and have played
     Recommends next video game based on similarities between video games
     This is percentage similar that they are (you will ike this ~80%)


How will this be implemented

VideoGame(nameOfGame, publisher, publishedDate, genreId, MetaCriticScore, platform)

// May not be needed
Genre(genreId, Genre)
MetaCritic Score(Reviewer, Score)

Similarity Algorithm - (possibly Netflix similarity algorithm - Logan)

We do not create a DB 

fetch from that db - 
mapper 


read only ... 


Keep version 0 simple - we can always add stuff to it.
Form that will get the genre etc

Version 1 - add a profile - so we login - and get a profile

Version 2 - store past games you have played - to get a genre, publisher preference

Front end framework -
